AN INTERSPECIFIC HYBRID IN EUROPEAN CALLITIUOB.E
The only naturally occurring hybrid population of Callitriche found
|during the past three years of investigation on the genus was at
lOillerad, Sjcelland, Denmark. A vigorous growth of CoUitricke was
pound in a number of ditches in the grounds of Frederiksborg Castle,
F30 km. north of Kebenhavn, during August 1957. The plants were
(between 15 and 35 cm. in length and much branched. The leaves were
mainly elliptical and the stamens were between 3 and 5 mm. long.
Preparations of pollen from several hundred anthers showed that the
ppollen was completely abortive. A careful search was made for female
flowers; but without success.
I Meiosis in pollen mother cells showed, during the first division stage,
rone quadrivalent, three bivalents and five univalents, the latter being
scattered throughout the cell. In addition most pollen mother cells
had either one or two chromatic bodies. At first and second anaphase
inhere was an unequal separation of the chromosome into each of the
daughter cells.
It would appear that vegetative propagation was the only means
M survival of the population as the plants failed to form fruits.
It is impossible to be sure of the parents of the Hillered hybrid but
from circumstantial evidence it would appear that they were V. platycarpa Kiitz.   and  C.  polymorpha Lonnr., both of which  occur in  the
vicinity of the hybrid population.    The parents must have been diploid
(2n = 10) and tetraploid (2n-= 20), since cytological investigation of the
hybrid shows it to be a triploid with 15 chromosomes.      Of   the   two
diploid species in Denmark, C.  polymorpha and G.  stagnalis Scop., it
is obvious that the hybrid is related to the former and not the latter
and while the hybrid resembles 0. platycarpa it is quite different from
I the other tetraploid species, 0. palustris L.J. P.  Savidge.
