H. DAVIDSON, V. G. ALLFREY, AN]) A. E. MIRSKY&#xA;THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE&#xA;Communicated November 13, 1962&#xA;This communication is concerned with the dynamics of gene control over specific&#xA;biochemical functions in a differentiated cell. Direct experimental access to the&#xA;intracellular link between gene action and the target cell characters has become&#xA;feasible with the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that the synthesis of&#xA;specific RNA's on the genomic DNA template is the actual primary mechanism of&#xA;gene function in the cell and with the development of the highly effective inhibitor&#xA;of that synthetic reaction, actinomycin D. In the experiments to be presented, this&#xA;agent was used to block nuclear RNA synthesis in a cultured mammalian cell type&#xA;which has retained in vitro a differentiated cellular activity. The effect of actinomycin&#xA;treatment on this cell function and on a specific mitochondrial enzyme&#xA;activity was then followed. Actinomycin treatment was found to inhibit the specific&#xA;cell function immediately, while, in contrast, the mitochondrial enzyme activity&#xA;appeared to remain impervious to the effects of this agent for long periods.&#xA;The cell line whose development made possible these studies is of connective tissue&#xA;origin. Termed ARE-2-60 and described in detail elsewhere,' its differentiated&#xA;property consists of the continuous synthesis and secretion into the culture medium&#xA;of acid mucopolysaccharides characteristic of connective tissue. The major advantages&#xA;of experimental material of this nature are twofold: it permits study of&#xA;cellular differentiation as a genetically inherited or genomically specified cell property,&#xA;and it provides for the expression of such properties an environment which is&#xA;devoid of complex (i.e., variable) tissue-tissue interactions. Since the cells grow in&#xA;a monolayer on a glass substratum, even cell-cell interactions are strikingly reduced&#xA;as compared to the case in normal tissue, organ culture, or artificial cell aggregates. 2&#xA;Differentiated cellular properties are determined ultimately by information carried&#xA;in the cell genome. The well-known Mendelian transmission of variant hemoglobin&#xA;forms serves as a classic illustration of this fact, for hemoglobin is a protein&#xA;whose mass production constitutes the end-product of a highly specialized cell, the&#xA;reticulocyte. The particular question to which this investigation is directed is the&#xA;degree of immediate control exercised by the active genes in another differentiated&#xA;system. Does a specific cytoplasmic function such as the secretion of some histospecific&#xA;cell product proceed independently once the synthesizing machinery is set&#xA;up, or is continuous gene action a requisite for the maintenance of differentiated&#xA;activity?&#xA;In monitoring ARE cell function under various conditions, it was found that the&#xA;per cell rate of AMPS synthesis was exceedingly sensitive to conditions affecting&#xA;the general rate of protein synthesis. Thus, in experiments utilizing low doses of&#xA;the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin, it could be shown that even at levels of&#xA;puromycin inhibition so mild that some net cell increase occurred during the 24-hr&#xA;period of the experiment, AMPS synthesis and secretion were inhibited 80-90 per&#xA;cent. This result set the stage for the experiments which now follow, for it suggested&#xA;the possibility that in this continuously growing cell type active nuclear&#xA;mediation might be required for the maintenance of the rate of protein synthesis on&#xA;which the AMPS production system depends.&#xA;Effect of Actinomycin D on Synthesis of RNA, Protein, and Cell-Bound AMPS.-&#xA;It 'is known that actinomycin functions by suppressing RNA-DNA polymerase&#xA;activity,' apparently by complexing specifically and firmly with the DNA primer,&#xA;9' 10 and it has been shown in other tissue culture systems that actinomycin&#xA;inhibits almost completely the synthesis of all cell RNA. &quot; 12 The small amount&#xA;of RNA synthesized in cells &#xb0;5 per cent inhibited by actinomycin treatment does&#xA;not resemble cell DNA in base composition' and in fact appears to consist mainly&#xA;of s-RNA.1' The irreversible nature of actinomycin action makes it possible to&#xA;consider cells which have been exposed to the drug and then transferred to actinomycin-&#xA;free medium as &quot;chemically enucleated&quot; cells.&#xA;In Figure 1 are presented the pooled results of several experiments in which RNA&#xA;synthesis and AMPS synthesis were measured simultaneously in replicate coverslip&#xA;preparations incubated for one hr with the respective C14 precursors at given intervals&#xA;following a 20-min actinomycin treatment. The result of the experiments&#xA;summarized in Figure 1 is clearcut: when 97 per cent of all cell RNA synthesis is&#xA;blocked by actinomycin D, the rate of AMPS synthesis begins to decline immediately,&#xA;without appreciable lag, and it continues to decline as long as it is followed.&#xA;It is evident that in order for this differentiated trait to be expressed, continuous&#xA;nuclear activity is required in the form of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. This&#xA;system is therefore characterized by immediate nuclear control. Parallel experiments&#xA;were conducted to measure the uptake of C'4-L-leucine into protein at various&#xA;intervals after actinomycin treatment. It was found that rate of total protein&#xA;synthesis (CPM/coverslip/one-hr incubation) declined at essentially the same rate&#xA;as does AMPS synthesis (Fig. 2). Franklin and Baltimore have published essentially&#xA;similar data showing the effects of actinomycin D on total protein synthesis in&#xA;L-cells. 12&#xA;In these experiments, isotopic labeling was carried out in actinomycin-free medium&#xA;containing 5 &#xb5;C/ml C14-orotic acid (for RNA), 1 &#xb5;C/ml C14-L-leucine (for pro-&#xA;tein), or 5-10IAC/mlN-acetylglucosamine-l-C14(forAMPS). Ninety-nine percent&#xA;of the counts incorporated from orotic acid were removable by incubation in 0.1&#xA;per cent crystalline RNAase. Protein samples were fixed in cold TCA in the same&#xA;way as RNA samples. Twelve to sixteen hr after planting (7X10^5 cells/coverslip),&#xA;the cells adhering to the coverslip surface were exposed for 20 min to actinomycin&#xA;D, at a final concentration of 5 ,g/ml, then rinsed free of the agent and transferred&#xA;to clean medium. No cell division occurs in the period between planting and exposure&#xA;to actinomycin.&#xA;Protein Turnover and Cell-Bound AMPS Synthesis Rate.-The effect of actinomycin on AMPS&#xA;synthesis could be due to its interference with protein synthesis,&#xA;in particular to interference with the synthesis of the enzymes which construct the&#xA;AMPS polymers (or their components). If this were the case, then a parallel&#xA;experiment to those of Figure 1, but where protein synthesis itself (rather than RNA&#xA;synthesis) is blocked, should cause a sharper fall in AMPS synthesis rates than was&#xA;found in the actinomycin-treated cells. Such was in fact the result (Fig.2) when the&#xA;effect of 50 &#xb5;g puromycin/ml on AMPS synthesis was tested. At this dose, over&#xA;96 per cent of the normal protein synthesis was obliterated. Since puromycin inhibition&#xA;is not irreversible, the 50 ,gg/ml concentration was maintained in the isotope-containing&#xA;media. AMPS synthesis in the one-hr incubation periods with&#xA;N-acetylglucosamine-1-C'4 at the given time intervals after the start of puromycin&#xA;treatment drops about five times faster than it does if RNA synthesis is blocked&#xA;instead. The short rise in AMPS synthesis at 15 min and 30 min above the control&#xA;values (Fig. 2) is not understood.&#xA;It would thus appear that the turnover of one or several key enzymes constituting&#xA;the AMPS synthesizing apparatus is so high that it must be continuously resynthesized&#xA;to maintain the normal AMPS synthesis rate. This is in line with the finding&#xA;that total protein turnover even in these rapidly growing cells is very high. At&#xA;the rate of protein turnover characteristic of ARE cells, 1 half the protein present&#xA;at any given time would have been replaced within three days, despite the rapid&#xA;accretion of new protein occurring simultaneously as a function of the characteristically&#xA;high rate of cell proliferation. Using another tissue culture cell line growing&#xA;at comparable rates, Eagle et al. reported the very similar value of 1.0 per cent protein&#xA;turnover/hr. 1 Since these turnover values refer to total cell protein, specific&#xA;protein constituents are probably characterized by much higher turnover rates.&#xA;Fast turnover of the AMPS-synthesizing machinery associated with a constant flow&#xA;of apparently short-lived, newly synthesized RNA molecules is the simplest explanation of&#xA;the results presented in Figures 1 and 2.&#xA;It is in any case evident that those RNA molecules on which AMPS synthesis&#xA;depends must turn over at a high rate, since decreased AMPS production is detected&#xA;within 20 min of actinomycin treatment (the shortest time the resolution of the&#xA;method permits). As total protein synthesis appears to fall at about the same rate&#xA;as AMPS synthesis in ARE cells and shows no lag before fall-off of synthesis rate&#xA;in similarly treated L-cells,'2 the result obtained with the specific AMPS marker&#xA;has a certain generality. Little is known about the rates of turnover of RNA&#xA;molecules synthesized by RNA-DNA polymerase in nucleated cells. One system&#xA;from which information bearing on this question has been derived is that of the&#xA;isolated calf thymus lymphocyte nucleus. In this nucleus, the bulk of the RNA&#xA;synthesized in a given period of time is messenger-type RNA, resembling cell DNA&#xA;in base composition.'4 The evidence suggests that this RNA retains its activity to&#xA;stimulate nuclear protein synthesis for only about 20&#xA;min from the time of its own construction.'5 Thus,&#xA;thymus lymphocyte messenger RNA would appear to&#xA;possess a high turnover rate, since it is rapidly synthesized and rapidly inactivated. &#xA;However, it is not profitable to speculate on which RNA component is the critically&#xA;affected one in actinomycin-treated ARE cells.&#xA;As Allfrey and Mirsky have pointed out,'7 both messenger and ribosomal RNA appear to be&#xA;synthesized from a DNA template, and in rapidly growing cells both are synthesized at a&#xA;high rate so that empirical distinctions betweenthem tend to blur.&#xA;The Effect of Actinomycin on Succinic Dehydrogenase Activity.-In order to gain a better&#xA;perspective on the immediacy of nuclear nuclear control in in ARE cells, it it was&#xA;decided to test the effect of actinomycin on an enzymic activity of a different type. &#xA;The widely distributed mitochondrial enzyme succinic dehydrogenase was chosen, since if&#xA;there is some component component of the cellular machinery which is not so immediately&#xA;dependent on nuclear control, it might well be sought in a cytoplasmic organelle such as&#xA;the mitochondrion. The idea that mitochondria are to be regarded as cell organelles&#xA;an old one.'6 Recent support for the view that mitochondria are relatively autonomous &#xA;cytoplasmic units (i.e., cell organelles) derives from studies of Fletcher&#xA;and Sanadi on mitochondrial turnover. turnover. These authors labeled rat liver&#xA;mitochondria with methionine S35 and acetate C14 and then followed the loss of label&#xA;from cytochrome C and several other mitochondrial components. They found that &#xA;radioactivity in all the mitochondrial fractions declined at the same rate, with a&#xA;half-life of 10 days, almost twice the half-life known for total liver cell proteins.&#xA;As the authors note, the picture obtained is that of breakdown (and synthesis) of the&#xA;whole mitochondrial entity at once, and this result is in accord with the organelle&#xA;theory. The report by Chevremont et al. that mitochondria in chick fibroblasts will&#xA;display under certain conditions a feulgen-positive material which becomes labeled&#xA;with thymidine-H' (DNA) might also be regarded as oblique support for the organelle &#xA;thesis.&#xA;Mitochondria, however, are also subject to central genomic control. Ephrussi&#xA;and co-workers22 have demonstrated single-factor Mendelian transmission of mitochondrial&#xA;respiratory enzyme systems in yeast. C. Raut has described other yeast&#xA;mutants in which specifically mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes are shown to be&#xA;controlled by a single Mendelian factor. In another organism, Neurospora,&#xA;cytochrome-free genetic mutants have also been identified. Measurement of&#xA;succinic dehydrogenase activity in actinomycin-treated ARE cells would indicate&#xA;whether genomic control over this, mitochondrial eiizyme is characterized by the&#xA;same immediacy as shown for AMPS and total protein synthesis in these cells.&#xA;Twelve to sixteen hr after planting, replicate ARE cultures were thus exposed&#xA;to 8 4g/ml lactinomycin for 20 min, the monolayer was rinsed and covered with&#xA;fresh medium, and at given intervals thereafter the cells were harvested. Cell&#xA;homogenates were then prepared as described below. Parallel coverslip cultures&#xA;with the same ratio of actinomycin to cells were used to monitor RNA synthesis&#xA;throughout the experiment with the same procedures as utilized in the experiment&#xA;of Figure 1. The results of two experiments measuring succinic dehydrogenase in&#xA;actinomycin-treated cells are shown in Table 1, expressed as m,1M succinate reduced&#xA;per mg of protein.&#xA;It is evident from the data of Table 1 that the specific activity of succinic &#xA;dehydrogenase shows no decline in cells suffering near-total blockage of nuclear RNA&#xA;synthesis for many hours. In fact, succinic dehydrogenase activity has increased&#xA;somewhat in the actinomycin preparations, perhaps as a by-product of the general&#xA;derangement of synthetic metabolism wrought by the actinomycin treatment&#xA;(total protein/106 cells remained constant throughout the experiment).&#xA;Succinic dehydrogenase activity was measured with a method adopted from the procedure of&#xA;K. Rogers26 originally intended for the estimation of succinate. This method depends on &#xA;suceinic dehydrogenase-mediated electron transport between succinate and the blue dye &#xA;2,6-dichlorophenol in the presence of cyanide to block further cytochrome-mediated &#xA;transport pathways. Succinic dehydrogenase is specifically inhibited by malonic acid, &#xA;and the activity of this enzyme was expressed as the difference in the decline in OD at&#xA;600 mji of the contents of two Beckman cuvettes, identical except for the presence of &#xA;about 10 times as much malonate as succinate in one of the cuvettes. Details of the assay&#xA;procedure are given in the legend to Figure 3. The cell extracts used for the enzyme &#xA;activity measurements were prepared as follows: Several million cells were washed in the&#xA;cold in 0.06 M Na/K phosphate buffer, and, after standing at 0-2&#xb0; for 30 min under&#xA;these hypotonic conditions, they were 100 per cent broken by three min of motor-driven &#xA;homogenization in a 2 ml Tenbroek homogenizer. Homogenates were then dialyzed at 0-2&#xb0;&#xA;against four 1:50 volumes of 0.06 M pH 7 phosphate buffer containing 0.01 M Na succinate. &#xA;Duplicate 0.40 ml samples were taken for protein analysis by the Lowry procedure,27 and &#xA;the remaining homogenate was kept in the cold until 15 min before measurement of enzyme &#xA;activity. Figure 3 shows curves typical for such preparations. According to a linear &#xA;standard curve for these reaction conditions,28 an OD change of 0.010 represents the &#xA;disappearance of 4 mjuM succinate, and thus, in the case portrayed in Figure 3, the &#xA;succinic dehydrogenase in the preparation catalyzed the reduction of 11.2 mjAM of &#xA;succinate during the six min of observation. Discussion.-The fact that AMPS production by&#xA;ARE cells falls without lag when DNA-dependent RNA synthesis is blocked serves as a &#xA;demonstration that AMPS synthesis is a genomically controlled cell character. The use of&#xA;actinomycin D thus constitutes a novel method for showing the dependence of specific &#xA;cellulular functions on gene action, one which is complementary to the classical methods.&#xA;The main focus of attention in this paper is the degree of immediacy which&#xA;characterizes genomic control over specific cell functions. AMPS synthesis, an&#xA;inherited differentiated character of the ARE-2-60 cell line, has been shown to cease&#xA;when gene action is discontinued, as does the total protein synthesis of these cells.&#xA;The apparent decay of AMPS synthetic activity in actinomycin-treated ARE cells&#xA;displayed a half-time of eight hr, and, since AMPS synthesis was shown to be&#xA;directly dependent on protein synthesis, that value constitutes a quantitative index&#xA;of the immediacy of gene control over this cellular function. In the same cell, however,&#xA;it was found that as long as 23 hr after obliteration of RNA synthesis the&#xA;specific activity of the mitochondrial enzyme succinic dehydrogenase remains undiminished.&#xA;Thus, gene action determining this enzyme system is characterized&#xA;by a low degree of immediacy. Nonetheless, it is to be stressed that the evidence&#xA;available at this time demonstrates clearly the existence of an ultimate genetic&#xA;control over mitochondrial systems though it also suggests a large degree of mitochondrial&#xA;autonomy. In considering the vital dynamics of intracellular function,&#xA;the immediacy with which a given cell character is controlled by its genomic determinants&#xA;is one of the main pieces of information necessary for understanding the&#xA;manner in which that character is integrated into cellular metabolism. It is therefore&#xA;of considerable interest to find that highly diverse degrees of immediacy in gene&#xA;control coexist within the same cell.&#xA;Turning to what is known about immediacy of gene control in other systems, the&#xA;main example among the cells of vertebrates is the reticulocyte. Hemoglobin&#xA;synthesis in the mammalian reticulocyte remains active for days after loss of the cell&#xA;nucleus, thus proving the existence of ribosomal protein synthesis systems29 which&#xA;do not require immediate gene action in order to maintain function, although it is&#xA;well known that hemoglobin synthesis is under genetic control. Of added interest&#xA;here is a recent observation that actinomycin D does not affect reticulocyte hemoglobin&#xA;synthesis.&quot; Whether the reticulocyte model is analogous to the succinic&#xA;dehydrogenase system studied here depends on whether the latter enzyme was being&#xA;synthesized in the.course of the experiment, which is unknown. On the basis of&#xA;present information, the situation is different in bacteria. Time lag between gene&#xA;action and the appearance of the target character has been studied in various ways&#xA;in bacteria and has been found to be of exceedingly short duration. For example,&#xA;0-galactosidase production in E. coli zygotes was detected within two min of the&#xA;introduction of the gene for ,3-galactosidase in a mating experiment of Riley et al.30&#xA;In another case, Lacks and Hotchkiss studied amylomaltase formation in pneumococcus&#xA;mutants constitutively lacking this enzyme, following introduction of the&#xA;gene for its synthesis by wild type transforming DNA, and it was found that amylomaltase&#xA;formation began after a lag of only six min.&quot; Other examples involving&#xA;virus-induced enzyme synthesis could be cited, e.g., the appearance of deoxycytidylate&#xA;hydroxymethylase in T-2 infected E. coli.32 All of these microbial systems&#xA;illustrate an extreme of immediacy in gene control over the respective cell&#xA;functions, compared to the case in the differentiated vertebrate cells studied. The&#xA;contrast serves to draw attention to one of the fundamental properties of nucleated&#xA;differentiated cells, the existence of mechanisms moderating and controlling the&#xA;inherited genomic potentialities carried by these cells. We know that genomic&#xA;control is exercised through the selective repression and activation of certain genetic&#xA;loci in certain cells. It is apparent that an even more subtle mode of genomic&#xA;control exists, represented by variations in the immediacy with which gene action is&#xA;reflected in the target cell activities. Since cell differentiation is the result of these&#xA;processes of genomic specialization and modulation, investigation into their nature&#xA;and mechanism is among the fundamental problems in developmental biology; for&#xA;it is now known that gene activity may be necessary for the maintenance of a character&#xA;as well as for its first appearance.&#xA;Summary.-Actinomycin D was used to study gene control over specific cellular&#xA;activities in an established cultured cell line preserving a differentiated biosynthetic&#xA;function in vitro. It was found that the specific biosynthesis characteristic of these&#xA;cells was subject to immediate genomic control, while, by contrast, specific activity&#xA;of a mitochondrial enzyme was not affected by actinomycin treatment.&#xA;This nomenclature is conventional. &quot;ARE-2-60&quot; denotes a culture line initiated February&#xA;1960 and constituted of altered rat eye cells.&#xA;"/>
